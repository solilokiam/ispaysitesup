# Is PaySites Up???

This is a small pun project dedicated to the other team in the company I'm working in. Somebody would say that their stability is not always that good. So I decided to create a small tool to check if their sites are working.

## Project Structure
In the ```server``` folder you can find a small microservice that pings some urls and returns the result.
In the ```client```folder there's a super simple (2 components) react app.

## Stack used
- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the frontend.
- [zeit's micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro) for the server
